See if you can create a sed command that will allow you to tag all the names
with <NAME> </NAME> tags (there are four names here):
(note: name tags should go around the whole name, not around first name and then
around last name)

This file contains some random Text. It
also has a Few names of various people.
Names such as John Adams. I just made up these
names randomly. Kind of like Thomas Jefferson probably would.
He was one of the Authors of the Declaration of Independence.
So I assume he was probably good at this sort of thing. Writing, I mean.
He was a Virginian, like the first U.S. president: George Washington.
Another president with that first name was George W. Bush. 
His dad was also president, and had the same first name... But we can't use him
for this test file because he has two middle initials.
Although... we could easily modify our sed command to handle that. Couldn't
we?
